# C - Makefiles

In this project, I practiced writing Makefiles.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files.

## Helper Files :raised_hands:

* [school.c](./school.c): C function that displays a seahorse in text.
Used for Makefile practice purposes throughout project.

* [main.c](./main.c): Main C function that runs the function defined in
[school.c](./school.c).

## Header File :file_folder:

* [m.h](./m.h): Header file defining the function prototype used in `school.c`.
